# 🚀 Employee Management System

A Full Stack Employee Management System built using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js)**. This application enables administrators to efficiently manage employee records through a clean, responsive interface with complete CRUD functionality.

---

# 📖 Project Overview

The Employee Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify employee record management. It allows administrators to perform all essential employee operations from a single interface.

The application follows a modern client-server architecture where:

- **React.js** handles the frontend UI.
- **Node.js** and **Express.js** provide RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB** stores employee information.
- **Axios** is used for communication between frontend and backend.

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of Full Stack Web Development including API integration, database operations, routing, and CRUD functionality.

# 📌 Modules

## 🏠 Admin Dashboard

The dashboard serves as the central interface of the application.

Responsibilities:

- Navigate through different modules
- Manage employee records
- Perform CRUD operations
- View employee information

---

## ➕ Add Employee

This module allows administrators to register a new employee.

Information includes:

- Employee Name
- Email Address
- Phone Number
- Department
- Position
- Salary

After submitting the form, the data is validated and stored in MongoDB.

---

## 📋 View Employees

Displays all employee records in a structured format.

Users can:

- View employee details
- Edit employee information
- Delete employee records

Data is fetched dynamically from the backend using Axios.

---

## ✏️ Update Employee

Allows editing of existing employee details.

Workflow:

- Select an employee
- Load employee data
- Modify required fields
- Save updated information

The backend updates the MongoDB document using a PUT request.

---

## ❌ Delete Employee

Allows administrators to permanently remove employee records.

Workflow:

- Select employee
- Click Delete
- Confirm deletion
- Record removed from database

---

# 🌐 REST API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| GET | /employees | Fetch all employees |
| GET | /employee/:id | Fetch employee by ID |
| POST | /create | Add new employee |
| PUT | /update/:id | Update employee |
| DELETE | /delete/:id | Delete employee |
